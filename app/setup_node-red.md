Integrating Node-RED for Web UI
- Install Node-RED: Follow the official installation guide for Node-RED on your computer or server where you'll host the web UI.
- Create a Flow for Time Selection: Use Node-RED to create a flow that allows users to select a time for the alarm. You might use a combination of inject nodes (to simulate button presses), function nodes (for processing time inputs), and dashboard nodes (for displaying the UI).
- Connect to ESP8266: Use the MQTT or HTTP nodes in Node-RED to communicate with your ESP8266. You'll need to send commands from Node-RED to the ESP8266 to set the alarm time and trigger the LED.
